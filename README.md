# Twitter-Bot
I have created a web application in django framework, which uses tweepy API to search for the tweets of specific keywords and replies automatically to the tweets provided by the user. It also has the functionality to reply to a specific number of top recent tweets entered by the user. 
Please type your API keys and tokens of your twitter handle.
